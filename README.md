# CDAC_DBDA_project
In this project, we are using machine learning to predict the crop production in India. We are using a dataset that contains information about the area, production, and yield of various 
crops across different states in India from 2000 to 2014. We are applying different machine learning algorithms to this dataset and comparing their performance. We are also exploring the
factors that affect the crop production and how they vary across different crops and regions. Our goal is to develop a reliable and accurate model that can predict the crop production in 
India for future years. This model can be useful for farmers, policy makers, researchers, and anyone who is interested in the agricultural sector in India.
